Spaceward Bound Web-Project
===========================

A web application that will help scientists obtain density measurements of microbiological soil crusts through the method of crowdsourcing. This web application will teach users about microbiological soil crusts and how to identify them. This web application will allow users to mark what they believe is a microbiological soil crust using a paint module written in JavaScript. 

This project is inspired by the NASA Spaceward Bound program. See [http://www.csupomona.edu/~rmogul/spacewardbound/Spaceward_Bound.html](http://www.csupomona.edu/~rmogul/spacewardbound/Spaceward_Bound.html "NASA Spaceward Bound") for more information.
