Spaceward Bound Web-Project
===========================

A web application that will help scientists obtain density measurements of microbiological soil crusts through the method of crowdsourcing. This web application will teach users about microbiological soil crusts and how to identify them. This web application will allow users to mark what they believe is a microbiological soil crust using a sketchpad module. 

This project is inspired by the NASA Spaceward Bound program. See [http://www.csupomona.edu/~rmogul/spacewardbound/Spaceward_Bound.html](http://www.csupomona.edu/~rmogul/spacewardbound/Spaceward_Bound.html "NASA Spaceward Bound") for more information.

The sketchpad module used was created by Ian Li and can be found on Github (https://github.com/ianli/raphael-sketchpad) and was created using the Raphael Javascript vector graphics library (http://raphaeljs.com/). Twitter's Bootstrap was used to design the website (http://getbootstrap.com/).

To veiw this project simply go to (http://alienorigins.org/) to test it out for yourself.
